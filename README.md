# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

This repository is dedicated to multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on determining the emotion conveyed in text, audio, and image data.

## Overview

Multimodal sentiment analysis involves analyzing different types of data (text, audio, and image) to understand the sentiment or emotion conveyed. In this project, we aim to develop models that can accurately detect emotions across multiple modalities.
